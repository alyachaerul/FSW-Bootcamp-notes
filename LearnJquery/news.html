        <h3>News Update from CNN</h3>
        <h1>What 'vaccine passports' mean for your summer vacation</h1>
      </div>
      <p class="p1">
        (CNN) â€” The words "vaccine passport" have a reassuring ring to them,
        perhaps conjuring up the image of a sleek, embossed document with
        watermarked pages and official stamps of approval. Flourished at border
        controls, it would open travel doors that, for so many of us, have been
        closed by Covid-19.
      </p>

      <p class="p2">
        Some destinations -- including the Seychelles, Cyprus and Romania --
        have already lifted quarantine requirements to visitors able to prove
        they're vaccinated. Others, such as Iceland and Hungary, have opened up
        to people who've recovered from Covid-19.
