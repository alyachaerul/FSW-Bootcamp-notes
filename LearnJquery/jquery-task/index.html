        (CNN) — The words "vaccine passport" have a reassuring ring to them, perhaps conjuring up the image of a sleek, embossed document with watermarked pages and official stamps of approval. Flourished at border controls, 
        it would open travel doors that, for so many of us, have been closed by Covid-19.
    </p>

    <p class="text">
        Some destinations -- including the Seychelles, Cyprus and Romania -- 
        have already lifted quarantine requirements to visitors able to prove they're vaccinated. 
        Others, such as Iceland and Hungary, have opened up to people who've recovered from Covid-19.
    </p>

    <p class="text">
        This raises the prospect that proof of inoculation or immunity could be 
        the golden ticket to rebooting travel and seems good news for people 
        eager to book summer vacations after months of lockdown, 
        particularly as vaccine rollouts gather pace.
